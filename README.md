# Keen Mind

**Keen Mind** is a Discord bot that makes virtual Dungeons & Dragons sessions easier.

## Commands

* **`!item <complete or partial name of item>`:** Returns a stat block for a given weapon, piece of adventuring gear, or mount. Armor and shields are coming soon.
* **`!spell <complete or partial name of spell>`:** Returns a list of details for the specified spell such as casting time, classes who can learn the spell, duration, area of effect, and more.

## Colophon

This bot is indebted to [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/), both of which made this project incredibly approachable.
